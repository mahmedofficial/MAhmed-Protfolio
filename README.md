**Project Experience**

**1. Info-Sarker Project (Bangladesh Govt. National ICT Project) Phase 2**

The goal of Info-Sarker phase 2 Project is to develop Bangladesh Government Intranet backbone, which connect more than 18000 government offices including National datacenter and Disaster recovery data center.

Accomplishment
• Continuously support to deploy Info-Sarker IP/MPLS Network as per Low Level Design
• IP network devices such as Firewall, Core switch, Access switch installation and commissioning in both national data center and disaster recovery datacenter.
• In disaster recovery datacenter, deploy inline IPS solution, firewall and core routers. Deploy MPLS over EBGP to smooth synchronization between national and disaster recovery data center.

2. Teletalk LTE Project

Teletalk incorporate HO-VPN LTE solution into their existing IP network. Moreover, IPSec has been introduced to encrypt LTE data traffic.

Accomplishment
• Configured Two Next Generation firewall in active-standby mode for end-to-end 4G data encryption using IPSec features.
• Configured VPN to access IP Core network securely over internet.
• Successfully deployed 14 core site routers as ASG to carry 2G, 3G and 4G traffic as per low-level design. 
• Lead technical team to integrate 3300 routers as CSG in remote sites directly connected to EnodeB.
• Successfully completed firewall, ASG and CSG devices version and patch upgrade.

3.  Robi LTE Project

Robi incorporate HO-VPN LTE solution along with ring topology for LTE deployment in their IP core network. In addition, a new datacenter has been introducing under this project.

Accomplishment
• In datacenter, several firewalls installed and configured, different security zones, policies, ACL, static route, NAT services are configuring;
• Successfully configured VPN gateway to access datacenter securely over public network through SSL tunnel;
• In core switches, different OSPF process and vpn-instance is being configured and used layer 2 connectivity for IT servers;
• Integration and troubleshooting newly installed ATN 950 routers as CSG;
• PE router services migration to newly installed Net Engine series routers;
• Configured and troubleshoot different IP Protocols OSPF, IBGP, EBGP MPLS, VRRP and so on;
• Coordinate and communicate cross-functional departments to ensure smooth execution of the project plan.

4. Banglalink Core Giga Project

Worked with a team to complete several projects for Banglalink IP core network. For instance, new Node B integration, O&M service integrated to MPLS Backbone network, Firewall installation and implemented into the network and so on. 

Accomplishment
• Instructed sub-contractor to install NE40-X8, NE40-X16 router, Edumone-1000 etc.;
• For IT related service customer had a separate network along MPLS network, we successfully integrate this network into MPLS network. Therefore, customer cost of maintaining separate network is greatly reduced. Moreover, devices on that network were another vendor, it was challenging to perform cross vendor migration;

5. Bangladesh Grameenphone IP Core Swap Project

Worked in a team to replace all the existing backbone and backhaul IP network equipment by new IP devices and installation, commissioning, integration as well.

Accomplishment
• Performed installation new devices, transform old device connectivity to new device as per design;
• Successfully performed backhaul site migration and configured all the services;
• Troubleshooting IP Protocols such as IS-IS BGP MPLS vpn-instance and so on;
